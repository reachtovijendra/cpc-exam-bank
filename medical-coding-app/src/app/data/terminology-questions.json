    ],
    "correctAnswerId": "B",
    "explanation": "Upcoding is the fraudulent practice of assigning a higher-level code than what is supported by the documentation to increase reimbursement. For example, coding a level 5 E/M visit when documentation only supports a level 3. Upcoding violates the False Claims Act and can result in fines, penalties, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Accurate coding must reflect the documented services."

    "correctAnswerId": "A",
    "explanation": "DRG stands for Diagnosis-Related Group, a patient classification system used by Medicare and other payers to determine hospital reimbursement for inpatient stays. Each DRG has a predetermined payment amount based on the principal diagnosis, procedures performed, complications/comorbidities, age, and discharge status. MS-DRGs (Medicare Severity DRGs) are the current version used by CMS."

    "explanation": "The combining form 'pulmon/o' refers to the lung. Pulmonology is the study of lung diseases. Pulmonary means pertaining to the lungs. Pulmonary embolism is a blood clot in the lung. Another combining form for lung is 'pneum/o' or 'pneumon/o' (pneumonectomy = removal of a lung, pneumonia = lung infection). 'Cardi/o' refers to heart, 'thorac/o' refers to chest."

Chondroplasty is surgical repair of cartilage. 'Oste/o' refers to bone, 'my/o' refers to muscle, 'ligament/o' refers to ligament."

    "correctAnswerId": "B",
    "explanation": "The suffix '-otomy' means making an incision or cut into a structure (temporary opening), while '-ostomy' means creating a new permanent opening (stoma). A tracheotomy is an incision into the trachea; a tracheostomy creates a permanent opening. A colotomy is an incision into the colon; a colostomy creates a permanent opening. This distinction is critical for correct CPT code selection."

    "correctAnswerId": "B",
    "explanation": "An embolus is a mass (usually a blood clot, but can be fat, air, or tumor cells) that travels through the bloodstream and lodges in a vessel at a distant site. A thrombus forms in place within a blood vessel. A thrombus can become an embolus if it breaks loose and travels. A pulmonary embolism is typically caused by a thrombus from the deep leg veins that travels to the lungs."
